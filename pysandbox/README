INTRODUCTION
 
  The sandbox libraries (libsandbox & pysandbox) provide API's in C/C++ and
  Python for executing and profiling simple (single process) programs in a 
  restricted environment, or sandbox. Runtime behaviours of binary executable 
  programs can be captured and blocked according to configurable/programmable 
  policies.
  
  The sandbox libraries are distributed under the terms of the New BSD license, 
  please refer to the plain text file named COPYING in individual packages.

FEATURES
  
  1. capture system calls with arguments from *sandboxed* binary programs in 
     runtime, and block malicious actions through user-defined policy modules;
  2. specify quota limit of resources allocated to the *sandboxed* program, 
     including cpu and wallclock time, memory, and disk output;
  3. minimize privileges of the *sandboxed* program, and isolate its execution
     from critical parts of the operating system;
