INTRODUCTION
  
  The sandbox libraries (libsandbox & pysandbox) provide API's in C/C++/Python 
  for executing simple (single process) programs in a restricted environment, or
  sandbox. Runtime behaviours of binary executable programs can be captured and 
  blocked according to configurable / programmable policies.

  The sandbox libraries are distributed under the terms of the New BSD license, 
  please refer to the plain text file named COPYING in individual packages.

FEATURES
  
  1. captures system calls with arguments from *sandboxed* binary programs in 
     runtime, and blocks malicious actions through user-defined policy modules;
  2. specifies quota of various resources allocated to the *sandboxed* program, 
     including cpu and wallclock time, memory, and output;
  3. minimizes privileges of the *sandboxed* program, and isolates its execution
     from critical parts of the operating system;
